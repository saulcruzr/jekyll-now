I'm a Computer Science Engineer specialized in Data Architecture and Business Intelligence. I graduated from [Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey](http://tec.mx/en/inicio) in 2010, where I also got my M.S. in Innovation and Technological Entrepreneurship.

I dedicate most of my time on Data Warehouse (Kimball Methodologies), ETL, Data Quality Semantic Models, OLAP Models, Reports, and Dashboards design/development, KPI/metric, data science, big data and machine learning.

### More Information

I'm currently working in a real estate firm as a Data Engineer, in the past I've worked in an International Consulting Firm as a Business Intelligence Specialist. I love my wife, data, baseball and the art of beer/whiskey.

Always missing my hometown and family in [Los Mochis, Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Mochis). I hope I can share all data related topics that I learn every day and at the same time, learn from you.
